## Overview of PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis

### PyBer Assignment Explanation 

V.Isualize from CyBer have given Omar & I a ride sharing data set to analyze using Python, Pandas & Matplotlib. We were to create a summary Dataframe of the ride sharing data by city type where we create a multiple-line graph displaying the total weekly fares for each city type. Classifying cities by rural, suburban and urban criteria we analyze the differences in ride sharing so the decision makers at PyBer are able to make informed decisions. 


## Results Analysis 

We were asked to retrieve the total number of rides for each city type, the total number of drivers for each city type, the sum of fares for each city type, the average fare per ride for city type and the average fare per driver for each city type. The table below provides all of this information of PyBer Ride Shares and displayed in the multiple line graph per request.
