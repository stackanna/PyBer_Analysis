## Overview of PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis

### PyBer Assignment Explanation 

V.Isualize from CyBer have given Omar & I a ride sharing data set to analyze using Python, Pandas & Matplotlib. We were to create a summary Dataframe of the ride sharing data by city type where we create a multiple-line graph displaying the total weekly fares for each city type. Classifying cities by rural, suburban and urban criteria we analyze the differences in ride sharing so the decision makers at PyBer are able to make informed decisions. 


## Results Analysis 

We were asked to retrieve the total number of rides for each city type, the total number of drivers for each city type, the sum of fares for each city type, the average fare per ride for city type and the average fare per driver for each city type. The table below provides all of this information of PyBer Ride Shares and displayed in the multiple line graph per request.

## Rural Results
Rural cities accounted for 5% of the rides shared & have less than 3% of the total drivers. Rural cities averaged almost 7% of the Total fares. The average fare per driver is 3x higher than that of urban cities, making each ride much more profitable for the driver in rural cities. 

## Suburban Results
Surbban cities accounted for 26% of the rides shared while employing 16% of the amount of drivers. Suburban cities accounted for 30% of the total fares. The average fare per driver is double that of urban cities and 30% less than suburban cities. 

## Urban Results
Urban cities accounted for 80% of the drivers employed by PyBer and 67% of the rides shared in total. Urban cities accounted for 62% of the total fares. Urban cities have a much higher demand for ride shares than Rural and Urban cities. The demand for drivers is much more significant as the need is higher, although like everything else in life, more demand increases the pool of drivers pricing fares for competitively. Having the lowest fares with the most drivers we can assume it is better to be a rider than a driver in an urban city location for PyBer.
